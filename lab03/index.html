    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Cut each chicken breast in half lengthwise, so you have 4 pieces total. Pound each piece to an even 1/2-inch thickness. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a wide, shallow bowl (a pie dish works well), combine the Italian breadcrumbs, whole wheat Panko breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, and pepper. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg whites until lightly foamy. </li>
      <li>Arrange your workstation in the following order: pounded chicken, egg whites, breadcrumb mixture, then the baking sheet. Working one at a time, dip each piece of chicken into the egg whites, shaking off any excess, then the breadcrumbs, gently patting the chicken as needed so that the crumbs stick to all sides.</li>
      <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly coat the tops of the chicken with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Bake until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160°F (use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness) and the crumbs are brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven, spoon 2 tablespoons of sauce over each piece of chicken, and top with a slice of mozzarella cheese. </li>
      <li>Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, about 3-5 additional minutes.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with basil and enjoy immediately, topped with extra sauce as desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Because it mixes the crunch of successfully breaded chicken with the rich, savory richness of melted cheese and acidic marinara sauce, chicken parmesan is my all-time favorite recipe. My appetites are always satisfied by the wonderful combination of flavors and textures in every bite. </p>
